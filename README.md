<h2>MultiShop Microservice Project</h2>
<p>This project is an e-commerce application developed using a microservices architecture. Designed with a microservices approach, this project enables users to register and log in, browse products, add them to their cart, and complete their purchases through a mock payment system. The project includes essential e-commerce functions such as user authentication, product management, cart management, and payment processing, offering a scalable and manageable structure. These features provide an infrastructure suitable for the needs of large-scale e-commerce projects.</p>
<h2>What is Microservice?</h2>
<p>Microservice architecture is a software development approach that aims to divide large and complex applications into smaller, independently manageable, and deployable services. In this architecture, each microservice performs a specific function and communicates with other microservices. This allows each part of the application to operate and be developed independently, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the software.</p>
